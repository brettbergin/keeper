1. Add the RBAC to limit lower priveleged users to only auto-generate secrets. they cant be imported or manualled entered by anyone other than an admin.
2. Introduce the approval logic the application already has developed into the backend into the user interface. Make approvals required by managers. Make sure there is a navigation to be able to see all open approvals, view historical, etc.
3. Provide a user interface to be able to configure the vault configuration and secrets manager configuration that keeper should use for its remote backend secret storage systems. This should only be available to admin and should live in the admin-panel. Implement a UI component in this page that shows the current status of the configuration. an apply button should save the config, keeper should dynamically handle the config change, and a new status should be provided. 
4. Move to using aws encyrption sdk for kms data evelope encyrption for secrets in our database. We currently have the kms library in place, but we want to make use of all the benefits of the encryption sdk.
